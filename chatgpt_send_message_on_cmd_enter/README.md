# ChatGPT Send Message on Cmd+Enter User Script

This user script allows you to send messages on the chat.openai.com website by pressing Cmd+Enter (or Ctrl+Enter) instead of Enter alone. This is useful for Safari browser users who inadvertently submit the form when confirming their Japanese input with Enter.

## Description

This user script modifies the behavior of the input form on the chat.openai.com website, specifically for users using the Safari browser. By default, the form submits when Enter is pressed, which can cause issues for users typing in Japanese on Safari. The user script intercepts the Cmd+Enter (or Ctrl+Enter) key combination and prevents the form submission, allowing users to comfortably confirm their Japanese input without triggering the form submission.

## Features

- Intercept the Cmd+Enter (or Ctrl+Enter) key combination to prevent form submission.
- Allows Safari browser users to confirm Japanese input with Enter without triggering the form submission.
- Works specifically on the chat.openai.com website.

## Installation

To use this user script, you need a user script manager extension installed in your browser. Here are the steps to install the script:

1. Install a user script manager extension such as Tampermonkey (for Chrome/Firefox) or Greasemonkey (for Firefox).
2. Click on the following link to open the script file: [chatgpt_send_message_on_cmd_enter.user.js](https://github.com/sammrai/userscripts/raw/main/chatgpt_send_message_on_cmd_enter.user.js).
3. The user script manager extension should detect the script and prompt you to install it. Follow the instructions to install the script.

Once the script is installed, it will automatically run whenever you visit the chat.openai.com website using the Safari browser.

## Usage

After installing the user script, visit the chat.openai.com website using the Safari browser and start using the input form. When you want to confirm your Japanese input, press Cmd+Enter (or Ctrl+Enter) instead of Enter alone. This will prevent the form submission and allow you to continue typing or perform other actions on the website without interruption.

Note: This user script is specifically designed for the chat.openai.com website and has been tested on the Safari browser. It may not work as expected on other browsers or websites.
